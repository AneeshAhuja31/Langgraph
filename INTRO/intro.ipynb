    "They are a linear sequence of steps. Each step transforms data and passes it to the next. A chain is deterministic-it runs the same way every time for the same input\n",

    "    Input → Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Output\n",

    "- ### Use Case:\n",
    "    - Text summarization\n",
    "    - Question answering\n",
    "    - Translation pipelines\n",

    "    - Simple and predictable\n",
